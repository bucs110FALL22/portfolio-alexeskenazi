# CS110 Midterm Exam

## DESCRIPTION
The program displays a "Polygon Rainbox". Uses Turtle to draw polygons of different colors with increasing size and number of sides.
The loop runs a few times to show the color change.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS
There are no known or incomplete parts.
The program does minimal arguments checks and error handling.

## REFERENCES
The formula to draw regular polygons was obtained from the chapter 03 lab instructions and applied in a creative way.
It was ported to work on Turtle instead of pygame.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS
If you are interested consider tinkering with the outer loop and making the offset change to create 'tubes' of shapes.
